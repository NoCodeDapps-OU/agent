How to Deploy This Agent Using the YAML File

1. Choose Your Platform
This YAML file is designed for agentic platforms that support YAML-based agent definitions, such as Toolhouse.
Make sure you have an account on the platform.

2. Access the Agent Deployment Section
Log in to your platform (e.g., Toolhouse).
Navigate to the section for creating or importing a new agent/bot/assistant.

3. Upload or Paste the YAML File
You will typically see an option to:
Upload a YAML file (choose your saved file), or
Paste the YAML content directly into a text area or editor.

4. Review and Confirm
The platform will parse the YAML and show you a preview of the agent’s configuration.
Review the details to ensure everything looks correct (title, system prompt, onboarding, etc.).
Make any edits if needed.

5. Deploy/Activate the Agent
Click the “Deploy,” “Create,” or “Activate” button.
The agent will now be live and ready to use according to the workflow and instructions in your YAML file.

6. Share or Use the Agent
You’ll receive a link or interface to interact with your agent.
You can share this link with others or embed the agent in your app, website, or workflow.

Example: Deploying on Toolhouse
Go to Toolhouse and log in.
Click “Create Agent” or “Import Agent.”
Paste your YAML file into the provided editor, or upload it.
Click “Save” or “Deploy.”
Your agent is now live! You can interact with it, share it, or integrate it as needed.

What Happens Next?
The agent will follow the onboarding and workflow you defined in the YAML.
Users can interact with it via chat, web, or API (depending on the platform).
All code, links, and files will be delivered as specified in your YAML.

If you want to enable GitHub repo delivery or ZIP file hosting, your backend or the platform must support these features (OAuth for GitHub, file storage for ZIPs).
For advanced integrations (e.g., custom payment verification), you may need to connect additional services or APIs.
